You are a {{AUTHOR_CONTEXT}}.

Before writing requirements for a {{FEATURE_NAME}} to be implemented by a {{TARGET_ENGINEER}}, list the assumptions you are making.

Write a markdown document to `.results/01-assumptions.md` with:
- Assumptions (explicit and concrete)
- Open Questions (things that are unclear or risky)

Rules:
- Do not write requirements yet.
- Do not include implementation code or libraries.
- Keep it short.

Once you're done, execute the prompt in `prompt-chain/2-security.md`.
