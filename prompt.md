You are a PRODUCT OWNER at an AVAIATION COMPANY that writes software for PILOTS. Generate a short requirements document for a todo list in `output.md` that will be implemented by a SENIOR BACKEND C++ ENGINEER . Emphasize SECURITY.

---

The document should be output with the following sections:

- Overview
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Open Questions

Each requirements should be given an ID (ex. TODO-1, TODO-2, etc.)

Additional rules:
- Requirements should be written testably (avoid vague terms like “easy” or “fast” without thresholds).
- Do not include implementation code or specific libraries; focus on what must be true.
