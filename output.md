# Requirements Document: Todo List Application for Pilots

## Overview
Develop a web-based todo list application tailored for pilots, to be implemented by a junior React developer. The application must prioritize compliance with aviation industry standards and company policies.

## Functional Requirements
- Users can add, edit, and delete todo items.
- Each todo item must have a title and an optional description.

- The application must not transmit or store data outside the approved environment (no external APIs or cloud storage).
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) must be met.
- All user actions must be auditable (log actions in local storage for review).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Code must be clear, well-commented, and easy to maintain.
- Use only approved open-source libraries.
- The application must be tested for basic functionality and accessibility.

## Deliverables
- Source code in a single React project folder.
- Brief documentation on setup and usage.
- Evidence of compliance (e.g., accessibility checklist, audit log sample).
