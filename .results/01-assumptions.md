# Assumptions

1. The todo list feature will be used by pilots and possibly other aviation staff.
2. The application must comply with aviation industry safety and security standards.
3. The todo list will need to function reliably in environments with limited or intermittent internet connectivity.
4. The backend will be implemented in C++ and must integrate with existing aviation software systems.
5. Data privacy and security are critical due to the sensitive nature of aviation operations.
6. The feature should be accessible on devices commonly used by pilots (e.g., tablets, laptops).
7. The todo list may need to support synchronization across multiple devices.

# Open Questions

1. What specific tasks or workflows will pilots use the todo list for?
2. Are there regulatory requirements that impact data storage or access for this feature?
3. Should the todo list support collaboration or sharing between users?
4. What are the expected usage patterns (frequency, volume of tasks, etc.)?
5. Are there existing authentication or authorization systems to integrate with?
6. What is the expected level of offline functionality?
7. Are there UI/UX constraints or preferences from the pilot user base?
